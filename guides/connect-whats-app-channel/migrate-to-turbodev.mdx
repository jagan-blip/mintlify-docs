## Migration from Another WhatsApp BSP

If your WhatsApp Business Account is currently active with another Business Solution Provider (BSP), you can smoothly migrate it to **Turbodev**. The migration steps may vary slightly based on your existing BSP, but the core process remains simple and secure.

## Assets Involved in Migration

The migration process requires coordination between the following three assets:

- The WhatsApp Business Account where your phone number is currently registered
- The phone number you want to migrate
- Your Turbodev account

## Step 1: Disable Two-Step Authentication (2FA)

Before initiating the migration, Two-Step Authentication must be disabled for the WhatsApp number you wish to move.

**How to disable 2FA:**

1. Log in to [**WhatsApp Business Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/)
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers**
3. Open **Configurations**
4. Locate **Two-step verification** and disable it

> If you only see an “Enable” option, it means Two-Step Authentication is already disabled.

## Step 2: Create Your Turbodev Account

After disabling Two-Step Authentication, sign up for your Turbodev account.

**Get started here:**\

Complete the signup process to access your Turbodev dashboard.

## Step 3: Connect Your WhatsApp Channel

Once your Turbodev account is ready, proceed to connect your WhatsApp Business number.

**Follow the WhatsApp connection guide:**\
https://docs.turbodev.ai/guides/connect-whats-app-channel/connect-your-whats-app

This step allows Turbodev to securely link your WhatsApp Business Account and initiate the migration process.

## Step 4: Re-enable Two-Step Authentication

After the migration is completed successfully, it is strongly recommended to re-enable Two-Step Authentication to secure your WhatsApp Business Account and maintain Official Business Account (OBA) eligibility.

**How to re-enable 2FA:**

1. Go to **WhatsApp Business Manager**
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers → Configurations**
3. Enable **Two-step verification**

## Migrating from WhatsApp Business API to WhatsApp Business App (or Personal WhatsApp)

If you plan to remove a phone number from the WhatsApp Business API and reuse it on the WhatsApp Business App or personal WhatsApp, ensure the following conditions are met:

### Before Requesting Deletion

- All outstanding payments must be cleared
- The phone number must not have sent more than **1,000 messages in the last 30 days**

If these conditions are not met, Meta will not allow the deletion request.

## How to Request Phone Number Deletion

To initiate the phone number deletion process, please contact the Turbodev Support team via WhatsApp using your registered number.

### Send a WhatsApp Message

Click the link below to start a chat with Turbodev Support:\

## What Happens After the Request

Once your request is received:

1. The Turbodev team reviews your account for pending dues
2. Incoming and outgoing messages on the number are temporarily paused
3. You are informed about the scheduled deletion date
4. A deletion request is raised with Meta
5. You receive updates until the process is completed

After successful deletion, the phone number can be:

- Reused on the WhatsApp Consumer App, or
- Re-registered on WhatsApp Business

<Note>
  Phone numbers previously banned by WhatsApp may follow different reuse rules.
