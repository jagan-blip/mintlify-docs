Before starting, confirm your current verification status in Meta Business Manager:

1. Log in to [**Meta Business Manager**](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/business-manager)
2. Click **Business Settings**
3. Navigate to [**Security Center**](https://business.facebook.com/settings/security)
4. Review your current **Business Verification status**

If verification hasn’t started yet, you’ll see an option to begin.

## Preparation for Meta Business Verification

To improve approval chances, make sure the following are in place:

- Your **business website is active**, secured with SSL (https), and clearly shows:
  - Business name
  - Address
  - Phone number\
    These details must match your Meta Business Manager information.
- If you plan to verify via **email/domain**, use an email address that matches your website domain (e.g., [info@yourcompany.com](mailto:info@yourcompany.com)).
- For **phone verification**, ensure the number can receive calls or SMS.\
  If IVR is enabled, temporarily disable it.
- Your **business or trade name** should be consistent across:
  - Website
  - Meta Business Manager
  - Legal documents\
    (If names differ, they should clearly reference the same business.)

## Documents Required for Business Verification

Meta requires businesses to submit official documents that verify their **legal business name, address, and phone number**.\
The accepted documents vary by country.

Meta cross-checks submitted details with official government records (such as the **Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)** in India). Because of this, it’s extremely important that all documents are **accurate, up to date, and consistent** with the information entered in Meta Business Manager.

### Accepted Business Documents

Meta provides a country-wise list of acceptable documents for business verification.\
You can view the complete and most up-to-date list here:

**Meta’s Accepted Business Documents**\

Commonly accepted documents include:

- Business Registration or License
- GST Certificate
- Business Bank Account Statement
- Utility Bill (for address verification)

**Important Notes:**

- The business name on the document must exactly match the name entered in Meta Business Manager.
- Address and phone number must be clearly visible.
- Documents must be valid and not expired.
- Upload clear, readable scans or images.
- Select the correct document language while submitting to ensure faster review.
