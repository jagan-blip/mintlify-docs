TurboDev’s Schedule Broadcast feature allows you to send WhatsApp messages to a selected group of contacts at a planned date and time. This helps businesses organize campaigns better, stay within WhatsApp messaging limits, and reach customers at the right moment.

A **message preview** is displayed on the right side, showing how the template will appear with dynamic fields populated for the first few contacts in the selected audience.

## Message Delivery Mode

While creating a broadcast, you can choose how messages are delivered to your audience, based on WhatsApp’s messaging guidelines.

### Advanced Mode – Optimized Delivery (Recommended)

This mode is designed for scaling large campaigns efficiently.

- Messages require approval before delivery
- If approval is delayed or unavailable, the system automatically falls back to Standard Mode

**Best suited for:**\
High-volume campaigns where optimized delivery improves reach and performance.

### Standard Mode – Regular Delivery

WhatsApp enforces delivery limits to ensure a good user experience. In Standard Mode, if some messages fail due to limits or temporary issues, TurboDev can retry sending them automatically if retries are enabled.

You can turn **Enable Broadcast Retry** ON and choose how retries are handled:

#### Smart Retry (Recommended)

- Set a **Retry Until** date
- The system automatically retries undelivered messages up to three times
- No manual interval setup required

**Ideal for:**\
Teams who prefer automated retry handling without manual intervention.

#### Manual Retry

- Manually configure up to **three retry intervals**
- Define when each retry should occur

**Best for:**\
Campaigns with strict timelines or controlled retry spacing.

## Target Audience

View the total number of contacts that will receive the broadcast.

Marketing Opt-in is enabled by default to ensure messages are sent only to contacts who have given consent, helping you stay compliant with WhatsApp policies.

## Broadcast Reply Settings

Choose how replies from recipients should be handled after the broadcast is sent.

You can assign incoming replies to:

- A specific team
- A particular user
- A bot

This ensures timely follow-ups and efficient conversation handling.

## Test Broadcast

Before sending the broadcast to your full audience, you can test it.

- Add up to **10 test contact numbers**
- Click **Send Now** to preview how the message appears

<Note>
  Test broadcasts consume message credits and count toward daily sending limits.

## Send Broadcast

Once all configurations are reviewed and finalized, click **Send Broadcast**.

Before sending, confirm whether this message is an **additional message to the same contacts within 24 hours**. This helps maintain compliance with WhatsApp’s 24-hour session rules and improves delivery success.
