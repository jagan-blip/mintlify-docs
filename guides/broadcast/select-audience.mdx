Let’s look at both options in detail.

Once your data is formatted correctly, upload the Excel file to TurboDev.\
Before proceeding, set the **Marketing Opt-in status** and choose the **phone number format**.

**Variable & Media Mapping**\
If your WhatsApp Template includes **pre-defined variables**, you can map them to the appropriate columns in your Excel file.

## Select from Contact Group

Send Broadcast messages using saved contact segment.

You can either:

- **Create a new Contact Segment**, or
- **Select an existing segment**

### Create a New Contact Group

Click on **New Segment**, apply filters based on fields such as tags, email, marketing opt-in, or other available attributes, and then name the segment.\
Once created, contacts that match the criteria will automatically be added to the group.

If your WhatsApp Template contains variables, ensure they are mapped correctly so each recipient receives a personalized message.

## Add Button Payload

Button payloads allow you to define actions when users interact with CTA or Quick Reply buttons.

Depending on your template:
