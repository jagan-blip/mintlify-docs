## Overall Broadcast Analytics

Once a broadcast is scheduled, you’ll be redirected to the **Broadcast Overview** page. This dashboard gives you a consolidated view of all your broadcast campaigns and their performance.

You can:

- Monitor the status of multiple broadcasts in one place
- Analyze how each campaign is performing over time

## Date & Status Filters

Use built-in filters to narrow down broadcast data:

- View performance for the last **7, 30, or 90 days**
- Filter broadcasts by status such as **Pending**, **Cancelled**, or **Completed**

This helps you quickly evaluate recent campaigns or review historical performance.

## Repeat Broadcast

If you want to resend a broadcast to the **same contact group**, TurboDev makes it easy.

- Click on the **three-dot menu** next to a broadcast
- Select the option to repeat
- Update the broadcast settings and schedule it again

This is useful for reminders, follow-ups, or recurring campaigns.
