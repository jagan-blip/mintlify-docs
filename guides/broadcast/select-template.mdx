The first step in creating your Broadcast in TurboDev is selecting the message template you want to send.

### Select Created Template

If you have already created a message template, click the **Select** button next to the template. You will then be redirected to the next step, where you can choose the audience for your broadcast.

If you haven’t created a template yet, click **\+ New Template** to create one for your campaign.\
You can refer to the guide on how to create a WhatsApp Template for more details.

<Tip>
  It is recommended to create WhatsApp templates in advance, as template approval may take some time. Once approved, templates can typically be used within 15 minutes.
