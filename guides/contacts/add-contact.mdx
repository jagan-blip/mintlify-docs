### Automatic Contact Creation

When a customer sends a message to your WhatsApp number for the first time, Turbodev automatically saves their contact details in your account.\
This ensures your contact list stays updated without any manual effort.

### Contact Creation Date

For every contact saved in Turbodev, the system records the date they were added. This allows you to understand when a customer first entered your database, helping you track engagement history and manage follow-ups more effectively over time.
