Contacts in Turbodev can be created through multiple methods, including:

- Creating a single contact from the Contacts module
- Creating a contact from the Conversations module
- Automatic contact creation when a customer sends an incoming message
- Bulk contact import
- Uploading contacts via Excel in the Broadcast module
- Contact creation through integrations, webhooks, or APIs

Below is how marketing opt-in is handled across each method.

### Single Contact Creation (Contacts Module)

When adding a new contact from the Contacts section, you’ll see a **Marketing Opt-In** field.

- Set it to **Yes** if the customer has given consent to receive marketing messages
- Set it to **No** if consent has not been provided

Contacts marked as **No** will automatically be excluded from marketing or promotional messages, and the system will notify you if you attempt to send one.

### **Contact creation upon receiving an incoming message**

When a customer sends an incoming WhatsApp message for the first time, Turbodev automatically creates the contact.

- In this case, the marketing opt-in is set to **Yes by default**

### Bulk Contact Import

Bulk contact import supports setting marketing opt-in during upload.

- While uploading the file, you can choose **Yes** or **No** for marketing opt-in
- The selected option will apply to all newly imported contacts
- Existing contacts will retain their previous opt-in status

- You can set the marketing opt-in using the provided dropdown
- The selected value applies only to **new contacts** created during the upload
- Existing contacts are not overwritten
