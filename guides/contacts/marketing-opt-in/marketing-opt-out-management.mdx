description: "Turbodev helps businesses manage marketing opt-outs responsibly by allowing customers to unsubscribe from marketing messages using clear opt-out instructions.

While Turbodev does not automatically add an opt-out footer, we strongly recommend including an opt-out message in the footer of all marketing templates to comply with WhatsApp guidelines and avoid account issues."

### Recommended Opt-Out Footer

When creating a marketing template, include a simple opt-out line such as:

> _Reply STOP to unsubscribe from future marketing messages._

This ensures customers clearly understand how to opt out of marketing communication.

### Handling Opt-Out Requests

When a contact replies with **STOP** or a similar opt-out keyword:

- Agents or bots should **manually update** the contact’s marketing opt-in status to **NO**
- The contact should be excluded from future marketing broadcasts
- Utility and service-related messages can still be sent if applicable
