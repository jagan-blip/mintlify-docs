Follow these steps to link your catalog:

**Step 1: Access Your Business Manager**

Visit your Business Manager at https://business.facebook.com/settings/

In the left sidebar, scroll down to the "Accounts" section and select **WhatsApp Accounts**.

If you manage multiple WhatsApp Accounts, choose the specific account you want to configure.

**Step 2: Open WhatsApp Manager**

Under your selected WhatsApp Account, click on **Settings**.

Then click on **WhatsApp Manager** to access the management dashboard.

**Step 3: Verify Your Phone Number**

Once WhatsApp Manager opens, navigate to **Phone Number** in the left sidebar to confirm your number is properly connected.

**Step 4: Access Catalog Settings**

Below "Phone Number" in the left navigation, click on the **Catalog** option.

**Step 5: Select Your Catalog**

Click the **"Choose a Catalog"** button to open the catalog selection dropdown.

Browse through the list or use the search bar to find your desired catalog by typing its name.

**Step 6: Connect the Catalog**

Once you've located your catalog, click **Connect** to link it with your WhatsApp Business Account.

**Managing Your Connected Catalog**

After successfully connecting your catalog, you'll see a **Disconnect** option. Only use this if you need to switch to a different catalog. Otherwise, keep your catalog connected to maintain seamless product integration with WhatsApp.

<Warning>
  Disconnecting your catalog will remove product visibility from your WhatsApp Business profile until you connect a new one.
