## Facebook Product Catalog

Think of your Facebook Product Catalog as your **digital storefront**. It holds all the product information images, prices, descriptions, and availability that customers see when browsing products on WhatsApp.

Before selling products through WhatsApp, you need to create and populate your catalog with accurate product details.

- A **Facebook Page** for your business
- A [**Business Manager account**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606) with full control
- Permission to create and manage catalogs under your business

### Steps to Create a Catalog
