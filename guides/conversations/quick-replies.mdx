To use Quick Replies during a conversation, you must first create **Canned Responses**. These saved responses act as the foundation for Quick Replies and can include text, images, videos, audio files, or documents.

Once created, Canned Responses can be easily accessed and sent directly from the chat window using the Quick Reply option.

## Step 1: Create a Canned Response

Before using Quick Replies, make sure you have added at least one canned response.

### Use Variables

Variables help you personalize messages using customer data already available in **Turbodev**.

For example, a message like:

> **Hello , can you please check the details?**

will automatically replace `{{name}}` with the customer’s actual name during the conversation.

**To add variables:**

1. Click on **Add Variables**
2. Select the required field from the dropdown list

<Note>
  Ensure the selected variable contains data; otherwise, it may appear blank in the message.
</Note>

5. Click **Save** to store the canned response

Once saved, the canned response will be available for use in chats.

## Step 2: Send a Quick Reply in Chat

After creating canned responses, you can use them while replying to customers.

1. Open the **Chat** with the customer
2. In the **Reply section**, locate the action icons
3. Click on the **⚡ Quick Reply icon**
4. Select the required canned response from the list
5. Click **Send**

The reply will be sent instantly to the customer.

## Edit or Delete Canned Responses

Once a canned response is created, you can manage it anytime based on your needs.
