### Available Inbox Filters

**Open**\
Displays all active conversations that are currently in progress and assigned to agents or bots.

**Unread**\
Shows conversations that have new or unread messages, including chats that are yet to be handled.

**Resolved**\
Displays conversations that have been marked as resolved after the enquiry or request has been addressed.

## Filter by Tags

You can further refine your inbox by filtering conversations using tags. This allows you to quickly view chats related to specific categories such as _new enquiry_, _follow-up required_, _paid_, or _high priority_.\
Tag-based filtering helps teams stay organized and respond more efficiently.

## Filter by Assigned User or Bot

Turbodev lets you filter conversations based on who they are assigned to. You can view chats assigned to a specific team member or bot and easily understand workload distribution across the team.\
This makes it simple to track ownership, balance workload, and manage conversations more effectively.
