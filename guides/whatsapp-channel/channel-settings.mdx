**Read Receipts**

Read receipts show whether a recipient has viewed your message, indicated by two blue checkmarks on WhatsApp. Turbodev gives you control over this feature with a simple toggle.

**Default Setting:** Read receipts are enabled by default.

If you prefer that customers don't see when you've read their messages, simply switch this setting OFF. The good news? Even with receipts disabled on your end, you'll still be able to see when customers have read your messages.

**To disable read receipts:** Go to Settings under your WhatsApp Channel and toggle the button OFF.
