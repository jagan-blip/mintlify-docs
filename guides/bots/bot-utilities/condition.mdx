description: "Use Condition logic to control how your chat flow progresses based on user data or previous responses. Conditions help you split the flow dynamically, ensuring customers receive relevant messages at the right time."

## Overview

The **Condition Card** allows you to evaluate data stored in variables and route the conversation accordingly. Based on the outcome, the flow continues through one of two paths:

- **On Success** – when the condition is met
- **On Interrupt** – when the condition is not met

This enables smarter, more personalized automation.

## Setting Up the Condition Block

### Adding the Condition Card

The Condition Card is built using four key elements:

- **Comparator (Variable)** – the variable that holds the user’s response
- **Operator** – defines how the value should be compared
- **Value** – the data you want to validate against
- **Logic (AND / OR)** – used when multiple conditions are added

### Comparator (Variable)

Select the variable that contains the customer’s input or stored information. This is the data Turbodev will evaluate to decide the flow direction.

### Operator

Choose the rule that should be applied to the variable, such as equals, contains, greater than, or less than.

### Value

Enter the value that the variable should be compared against. The condition will check whether the variable meets this requirement.Enter the value that the variable should be compared against. The condition will check whether the variable meets this requirement.

### Using AND / OR Logic

When working with multiple conditions:

- **AND** ensures all conditions must be satisfied
- **OR** allows the flow to proceed if any one condition is met

This gives you flexibility to handle complex decision-making within a single flow.

## Flow Outcomes

Once the condition is evaluated, the chat flow continues through:

- **On Success** – when the condition logic returns true
- **On Interrupt** – when the condition logic fails

You can connect each path to different actions, messages, or flows to guide users appropriately.
