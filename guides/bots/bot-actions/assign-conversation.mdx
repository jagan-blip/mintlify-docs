## Overview

The **Assign Conversation Card** allows automation to seamlessly transfer a conversation to a human agent, team, or bot whenever needed. This helps maintain continuity, balance workload, and ensure customers get timely and relevant responses.

## Assigning the Conversation

With Turbodev, you can route a conversation to:

- A specific **user**
- A specific **bot**

This flexibility ensures every conversation reaches the right handler at the right moment.

## Assign to a User

When the **Assignee Type** is set to _User_, you can select from the list of team members added to your Turbodev account. The chosen user will take ownership of the conversation and continue communication directly with the customer.

## Assign to a Bot

If the **Assignee Type** is set to _Bot_, the conversation will be handed over to one of your configured bots. The bot will then continue the interaction based on the defined flow and automation logic.

<Tip>
  Use the Assign Conversation card strategically to transition from automation to human support, or to reassign chats based on customer intent, priority, or availability.
