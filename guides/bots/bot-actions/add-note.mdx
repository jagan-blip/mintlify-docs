## Overview

The **Notes** feature in Turbodev allows agents and bots to add internal notes to a conversation. These notes are visible only to your team and are not sent to the customer. Notes help teams capture important context, instructions, or observations that may be useful for future follow-ups or handovers.

## How to Use Notes

To add a note:

1. Write the note in the provided note field
2. Save the note to attach it to the conversation

Once added, the note will appear inside the conversation timeline, allowing any team member who later accesses the chat to quickly understand the context.

## Why Use Notes

Notes are especially useful for:

- Recording customer requirements or preferences
- Adding internal instructions for follow-ups
- Maintaining context when conversations are reassigned
- Ensuring smooth collaboration between team members
