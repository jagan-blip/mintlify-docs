## Overview

The **Resolve Conversation Card** is used to mark a conversation as resolved after successfully collecting the necessary details from a customer. This helps teams keep the inbox clean, focused, and organized.

## How It Works

When this card is triggered:

- The conversation is marked as **Resolved**
- All chat history, notes, and collected data are retained
- The conversation is removed from the active inbox view

Agents can manually reopen the conversation later if further communication is required.
