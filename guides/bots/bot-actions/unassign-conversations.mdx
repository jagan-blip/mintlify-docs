## Overview

The **Unassign Conversation Card** removes the current assignment from a conversation created during a chat-flow. Once unassigned, the conversation becomes available for reassignment to another agent, team, or bot without losing any previous context.

## How It Works

When this card is triggered:

- The conversation is unassigned from the current user or bot
- All messages, notes, and collected data remain preserved
- The chat can be picked up later by the appropriate handler

This is especially useful when a flow ends, pauses, or needs manual intervention.
