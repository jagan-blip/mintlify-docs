### Header

The header lets you add a **short title or headline** for the collection. This helps customers instantly understand what the collection is about, such as _“New Arrivals”_, _“Best Sellers”_, or _“Your Order Items”_.

### Message

The message section allows you to add **supporting text** for the collection. You can describe product features, highlight offers, explain benefits, or guide the customer on what to do next.

### Use Variables

You can personalize the message using variables collected from customers, such as name or order details.\
Simply click **Add Variables** and select the required field. Make sure the selected variable already contains data, otherwise it will not appear in the message.

### Catalog

Select the **connected product catalog** from which the collection will be displayed.\
If your catalog is not yet connected, you will need to complete the catalog integration before using this option.

### Collection

A collection is a **group of related products** within your catalog. Selecting a collection allows customers to view multiple items together, making browsing and purchasing easier inside WhatsApp.

### Footer (Optional)

You may include optional information at the bottom of the message, such as business details or helpful instructions. Footer content is not mandatory and can be customized based on your communication needs and compliance practices.

### Edit, Duplicate, or Delete Send Collection Card

When building or updating a flow, you can easily manage the Send Collection card:

- **Edit** the card to update content or change the collection

- **Delete** the card if it’s no longer needed
