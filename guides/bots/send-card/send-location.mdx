### Understanding Send Location

The Send Location feature allows you to send a **specific, static location** to users. It is commonly used to guide customers to offices, stores, event venues, or landmarks by sharing clear location details.

### Send Location Essentials

When using the Send Location card, you’ll be asked to provide the following information:

#### Name

This is the name of the location you are sharing. It can be a business name, landmark, or any identifiable place.

### Address

Enter the full address of the location, including street details, city, and country, to help users recognize the place easily.

### Location

You can define the location in either of the following ways:

- **Search Location**\
  Search for the location by entering its name or address. You can use the _View on Map_ option to verify that the selected place is correct.
- **Latitude & Longitude**\
  Manually enter the exact latitude and longitude coordinates of the location if you already have them.

<Note>
  Only **static locations** can be shared. Live or real-time locations are not supported through the WhatsApp Business API.
