### Overview

The Send Products card lets you share **one or more specific products** from your connected product catalog inside a chat flow or conversation. It’s ideal when you want to promote selected items rather than an entire collection.

Before using this card, ensure that your **product catalog is connected** to Turbodev.

### Sending Products in a Chat Flow

Once the catalog is set up, you can add the Send Products card to your flow and choose which products to display to the customer.

### Message

The message section allows you to add **detailed information** about the product, such as key features, benefits, pricing notes, offers, or usage instructions. This helps provide context and guides the customer on what to do next.

### Use Variables

You can personalize your product message using customer data collected earlier in the conversation.\
Click **Add Variables** to select from available fields. Ensure the selected variable contains data; otherwise, it will not appear in the message.

### Static Products

From the dropdown, select the **product(s)** you want to display from your connected catalog.

If you choose to showcase **multiple products**, make sure to update the header accordingly so the message clearly reflects that more than one product is being shown.

### Footer (Optional)

The footer appears at the bottom of the message and can be used to include helpful or compliance-related information, such as:

- Business name or contact details
- Instructions for opting out of messages
- Disclaimer or copyright text
- Links to your website or social profiles

Footer content is optional and can be customized based on your messaging requirements.

### Edit, Duplicate, or Delete Send Products Card

While building or editing a flow, you can easily manage the Send Products card:

- **Edit** the card to change product details or content
- **Duplicate** the card to reuse it elsewhere
- **Delete** the card if it’s no longer required

These options appear when you hover over the card, allowing quick updates without rebuilding the flow.
