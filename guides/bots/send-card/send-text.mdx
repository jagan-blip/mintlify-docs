### Send Text Card

The **Send Text Card** allows you to send plain text messages to customers with just a few clicks. It is commonly used in bot flows, automated follow-ups, and conversation handling to deliver clear and timely messages.

### Use Variables

Variables help you personalize messages using customer data already available in Turbodev.\
For example, a message like:

> _Hello , how can we help you today?_

will automatically replace `{{name}}` with the customer’s actual name.

To add variables:

- Click on **Add Variables**
- Select the required field from the dropdown list

<Note>
  Ensure the selected variable contains data; otherwise, it may appear blank in the message.
</Note>

### Edit, Duplicate, or Delete Send Text Card

You can manage Send Text cards easily while building flows:

- **Edit** the card to update the message content
- **Duplicate** the card to reuse the same message in another part of the flow
- **Delete** the card if it is no longer needed

These options appear when you hover over the Send Text card, making flow management simple and flexible.
