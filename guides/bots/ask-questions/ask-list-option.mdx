### Overview

The Ask List Option card allows you to display up to **10 selectable options** in a single message. It’s ideal for menus, FAQs, service categories, or any scenario where customers need to choose from multiple options without typing.

### How to Use It

### Header Type

Use this field to add a short heading that sets context for the list. For example, a welcome message or a brief introduction to what the options represent.

### Question Text

This is where you ask the main question or explain what the list is for. It helps guide the customer on how to use the options provided.

### Footer

The footer can contain supporting information such as your business name, a short tagline, or any additional context related to the list.

### Options Type

**Static Options**\
Static options remain fixed for all users and are best suited for standard menus or predefined selections.

You can:

- Add up to **10 options**
- Organize options into **multiple sections** for better clarity

### Validation Settings

**Attempt**\
Set how many times the question should be repeated if the customer provides an invalid response.

**Validation Error Message**\
This message is shown when the customer responds with something other than the listed options, guiding them to choose correctly.

**Action on Invalid Response**\
Define how the flow should proceed when an invalid response is received:

- End the flow
- Skip the question
- Proceed to fallback

### Store Response in Variable

Save the customer’s selected option into a variable for use later in the flow. You can create a new variable or select an existing one while configuring the card.

### Save

Once all required fields are configured, click **Save** to activate the card and continue building personalized flows based on the customer’s selection.
