### Overview

The Ask Button Option card allows you to ask a question and present up to three predefined response options as buttons. This makes it easier for customers to take action, whether they want to explore products, proceed with a purchase, or request more information.

You can also enhance the experience by adding media such as images, videos, text, or documents along with the question.
