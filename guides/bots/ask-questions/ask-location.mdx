### Overview

The Ask Location card allows you to collect a user’s location directly through WhatsApp. When triggered, customers can share their location using the map interface, ensuring accurate coordinates for deliveries, service visits, or verification.

### Available Fields

**Attempts**\
Set how many times the question should be asked if the customer sends an invalid or unrelated response.

**Validation Error Message**\
This message is shown when the customer responds incorrectly or does not share their location.

**Action on Invalid Response**\
Choose what happens if the response is invalid. You can end the flow, skip the question, or route the conversation to a fallback step.

**Store Response in Variable**\
Save the shared location in a variable for later use in the bot flow. You can create a new variable or select an existing one directly while configuring the card.

### Save the Card

After configuring all required fields, click **Save** to activate the Ask Location card in your flow.

When sent, the Ask Location card displays a **“Send Location”** button. Tapping this button opens WhatsApp Maps, allowing the user to quickly share their location coordinates.
