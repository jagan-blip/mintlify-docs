Once your Shopify store is connected with TurboDev, you can automate customer communication across the entire order lifecycle. Shopify workflows allow you to automatically send WhatsApp messages based on real-time customer actions such as placing an order, abandoning a cart, or receiving a delivery.

These workflows help you improve customer experience, increase conversions, and eliminate manual follow-ups.

## How Shopify Workflows Work in TurboDev

TurboDev connects directly with your Shopify store and listens for key events such as:

- Cart abandoned
- Order created
- Order fulfilled
- Order delivered
- Order cancelled

When one of these events occurs, TurboDev automatically triggers the workflow and sends the configured WhatsApp message to the customer.

You can fully customize the message, timing, and automation logic using the visual workflow builder.
