Generic Webhooks in Turbodev allow you to connect external platforms, applications, or systems with Turbodev and automatically trigger WhatsApp messages based on real-time events.

Using webhooks, you can send automated WhatsApp notifications when events occur in your CRM, website, app, forms, or any third-party system.

This integration enables fully automated messaging without manual intervention.

## What is a Generic Webhook?

A webhook is a unique URL generated by Turbodev that listens for incoming data from external platforms.

When your external system sends data to the Turbodev webhook URL, Turbodev captures the data and triggers the configured workflow automatically.

This allows you to automate:

- Lead notifications
- Order alerts
- Appointment confirmations
- Follow-ups
- Customer communication

This allows TurboDev to receive real-time data.

2. Return to Turbodev
