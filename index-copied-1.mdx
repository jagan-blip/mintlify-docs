The WhatsApp Business API enables businesses to handle customer support, send messages, and engage with customers at scale. Before you begin using WhatsApp Business API through Turbodev, you'll need to meet certain requirements. Let's walk through these pre-requisites to ensure a smooth setup!

## Pre-requisites:

### **Facebook Business Manager Account**

This free Facebook tool helps you oversee your business presence across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. If you haven't set one up yet, visit https://business.facebook.com/ to create your Facebook Business Manager Account.

<Note>
  You'll need either a Facebook page or an Instagram page for your business to create a Business Manager account.

### **Business Website**

Your website often serves as the initial touchpoint between your business and prospective customers. When integrating WhatsApp Business API with Turbodev, your website acts as a verification tool to confirm your business's authenticity and provides customers with a direct communication channel through WhatsApp.\

### **Phone Number**

Your WhatsApp Business Account requires a dedicated business phone number. Personal phone numbers cannot be used with the Business API. This number must not be actively connected to WhatsApp elsewhere during the setup process.Create beautiful pages

### **Verify Your Phone Number:**

Before starting the integration, you must verify your phone number via call or SMS. Important: Your phone number must not be linked to any existing WhatsApp Business Mobile App or another service provider's platform during integration.

</Note>

If your business currently uses WhatsApp on a mobile device and you want to use that same number for API integration, you'll need to remove the existing WhatsApp account from that number.

- Open WhatsApp app settings and select -\> "Account" -\> "Delete my account."
- Alternatively, register a new phone number for WhatsApp API if you prefer to keep your current Business WhatsApp Number active on mobile.

### **Connect with Your Facebook Business Account:**

To optimize workflow efficiency, authenticate using your existing Facebook Business Account. This ensures smooth integration. If you don't have a Facebook Business Account yet, you can create one during the integration process.

<Note>
  Please be aware:

  - Once integrated, WhatsApp will no longer function on your mobile device, and your previous chat history and contacts won't transfer to Turbodev.
  - If you wish to switch back to WhatsApp Business or the standard WhatsApp Mobile App after integrating with Turbodev, contact Turbodev support for guidance.

## Business Website for Meta Verification

To achieve Meta Business Verification and unlock higher messaging limits, your business website should prominently feature these key components:

1. **Business Identity**: Display your business name, logo, and contact details clearly to build trust and credibility.
2. **About Us Section**: Provide comprehensive information about your business operations, mission, and core values so Meta can understand your business model.
3. **Privacy Policy**: Include a detailed privacy policy explaining how customer data is collected, utilized, and safeguarded.
4. **Terms of Service**: Maintain current terms of service that reflect your business practices and communication methods.
5. **Contact & Support Information**: Demonstrate your dedication to customer service, showing how you'll use WhatsApp to improve customer communication.

Successfully completing Meta Business Verification requires a professional website that showcases your brand identity and demonstrates your commitment to privacy and customer care. This establishes a credible foundation for leveraging WhatsApp as your primary communication channel.
